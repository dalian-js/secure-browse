# Secure Browse

## Overview

**Secure Browse** is a Chrome extension designed to enhance your online security by managing other extensions based on the websites you visit. This extension automatically disables non-whitelisted extensions when you visit financial websites, ensuring a safer browsing experience. When you navigate away from these sites, it re-enables the previously disabled extensions.
